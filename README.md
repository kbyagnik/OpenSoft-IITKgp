# Problem Statement
Powering Rural regions with connect using phones with sparse 2G & Bluetooth connections


# Objective
Mobile phones penetration in Rural India is increasing comparable to TV & Radios, which were the traditional source of entertainment and educative information. Although the mobile phones can be a great medium for serving the same, but these mobile phones have limited (part of the day) or no data-access. Your objective is to build a system to make the "relevant" or "popular" content available on these phones offline by pushing the data when the phones come online, most importantly the system should have a rich search experience.


# Constraints
You will have 100 videos of each 3-8MB roughly (in total say about 500MB)
In addition, 1000s of rich text content like Weather info, Commodities info, Educational info
Phones have sporadic Data connection, may have 1 to 4 hrs of connectivity every day
Data Speed (2G) is assumed to be in the range of 22 to 80 Kbps (average: ~56Kbps)
Maximum Data storage available on phone will be 256 MB


# Evaluation Criteria
Fully Database searchable with rich experience offline
Relevant content made available offline,Ã‚ Maximum search hits during offline.
System should have offline Learning capability and it should benefit the entire user-base
Any innovative ideas using phone capabilities like Bluetooth or any other way to optimise data-usage.

PS: This can be simulated on stand-alone or web-app, not necessary to showcase as an Android app, it left to the Student's ability.
